Hereâ€™s an example of creating a Docker network with custom options:

```Dockerfile
docker network create \
  --driver bridge \
  --subnet 172.18.0.0/16 \
  --gateway 172.18.0.1 \
  --ip-range 172.18.0.0/24 \
  my-custom-network
```
In this example:

- `--driver bridge`: Specifies the network driver as bridge. You can use other drivers like overlay, macvlan, etc., based on your requirements.
- `--subnet 172.18.0.0/16`: Defines the subnet for the network.
- `--gateway 172.18.0.1`: Specifies the gateway IP address for the network.
- `--ip-range 172.18.0.0/24`: Defines the range of IP addresses that can be assigned to containers on this network.
- `my-custom-network`: The name given to the network.
